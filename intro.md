# Avengers: Fracture Point

A temporal rift has split the world into fragments of time and space. Chaos spreads across the globe. Nick Fury sends out an urgent message:

> "Avengers, assemble. The world needs you now more than ever."

The team gathers at the crumbling ruins of the Avengers Compound. The temporal rift hovers above them, unstable and glowing with cosmic energy.

Four paths appear in the rift â€” each leading to a key location that could be vital in restoring balance.
